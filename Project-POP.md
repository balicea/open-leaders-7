### Purpose:
To provide a platform for facilitating contributions and presenting key ideas to potential contributors in the OpenWorm Foundation community, focusing on the DevoWorm group.

### Outcomes:
* new collaborations and contributions are enabled.

* new contributors can bolster their existing strengths with knowledge in new areas (facilitate interdisciplinary knowledge).

* new contributors can help build and refine a collaborative education platform.

### Process:
* new contributors can enroll in the course via Eliademy (any combination of course materials is sufficient to maintain enrollment).

* new contributors can also review and contribute to the Eliademy front-end and Github repo.

* contributions can come in the form of web annotation (hypothes.is), pull requests for new/modified course content, or web notes (pushed to Github repo).
